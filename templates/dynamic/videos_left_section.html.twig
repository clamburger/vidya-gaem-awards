<h2>Last year's competition was a success, so we're bringing it back for 2019.</h2>
<p>
  We had an enormous number of submissions last year with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRq_DUMVkbQ" target="_blank">No Man's Stranding</a>
  taking the cake as best skit. This year, we're bringing the competition back, and increasing the prize to $120 USD.
</p>
<p>
  You don't expect to much and you shouldn't either, but with 20 more dollars, who knows what we can expect?
</p>
<p>
  This year we are also accepting bumpers, but note that <strong>bumpers are not eligible for the cash prize</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  If you have something that you think is funny and deserves a spot on the /v/GAs, then go ahead and submit it!
  It doesn't have to be serious, just quality vidya content.
</p>
<p>
  If you're already rich and don't want the cash prize, you can choose to have it donated to a charity of your choice.
